Todo List:

-----------------------YOSSI--------------------------------

1. Fix destructors (instead of  for loop, do a while loop where each iteration pops) - Yossi.
2. Reset the scene after loading a file (update GUI values) - Together.
3. Each model have a list of geometries (otherwise BBox is wrong, example: cow) - DONE.
4. Create Perspective projections (using left, right, bottom, up, and using FOV and AspectRatio) - DONE.
5. Draw BoundingBox - DONE.
6. Draw Normals - DONE for now (maybe add fix for scaling - low priority).
7. Add View transformation - Yossi - DONE (except for the the rotation).
7. Add View transformation - Yossi.
9. Normal Calc/File - Yossi - DONE.
13. Reload file after tessallation - Yossi (maybe together).
14. Resizing - Yossi - DONE.
15. Perspective Control GUI - Yossi - DONE.
16. Colors dialog connection - Ben.

-----------------------BEN--------------------------------

15. Perspective Control GUI, connections - Together.

12. Tessalltion dialog and connection to scene
	Need to clear screen and reload file after making change
	
11. Enable more than one axis.
	Z axis SCALE & TRANSFORM on ortho not moving anything - does this make sense?
	
8. Mouse Sensitivity dialog
	Ben, issue with gui updating.
	
	
	2 - 20 tessallation
	
	make view object if 
-----------------------TOGETHER--------------------------------
