Todo List:

1. Fix destructors (instead of  for loop, do a while loop where each iteration pops) - Yossi.
2. Reset the scene after loading a file (update GUI values) - Together.
3. Each model have a list of geometries (otherwise BBox is wrong, example: cow) - DONE.
4. Create Perspective projections (using left, right, bottom, up, and using FOV and AspectRatio) - DONE.
5. Draw BoundingBox - DONE.
6. Draw Normals - Done for now (maybe add fix for scaling - low priority).
7. Add View transformation - Yossi.
8. Mouse Sensitivity dialog - Ben.
9. Normal Calc/File - Yossi.
11. Enable more than one axis - Ben (maybe together).
12. Tessalltion dialog and connection to scene - Ben.
13. Reload file after tessallation - Yossi (maybe together).
14. Resizing - Yossi.
15. Perspective Control GUI - Ben, connections - Together.
16. Colors dialog connection - Ben.
17. Advanced options - for now the second option - Together.
