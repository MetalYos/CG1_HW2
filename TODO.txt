Todo List:

-----------------------TODO----------------------------------
1. Comment the hell out of the code.
2. Change it so the tessellation parameter is from view (in case it is not allowed to change a signature of a function from irit).
3. Add a button to control if Rot/Scale in View space is around camera or object.
4. Add a button (or menu option) to control normal size factor.
5. Save color in Geometry as well and add a button to see color per geo or of the whole model.
6. Add renderer class and abstract some of the functions in CGView to it - lowest of low priorities.




-----------------------DONE--------------------------------
17. Advanced options - for now the second option - Together.
6. Draw Normals - DONE for now (maybe add fix for scaling - low priority).
7. Add View transformation - Yossi - Fix scaling in view space
16. Colors dialog connection - DONE 
3. Each model have a list of geometries (otherwise BBox is wrong, example: cow) - DONE.
4. Create Perspective projections (using left, right, bottom, up, and using FOV and AspectRatio) - DONE.
5. Draw BoundingBox - DONE.
2. Reset the scene after loading a file (update GUI values) - Together.
3. Each model have a list of geometries (otherwise BBox is wrong, example: cow) - DONE.

1. Fix destructors (instead of  for loop, do a while loop where each iteration pops) - Yossi.

15. Perspective Control GUI, connections - Together.

12. Tessalltion dialog and connection to scene
	Need to clear screen and reload file after making change
	
11. Enable more than one axis.
	Z axis SCALE & TRANSFORM on ortho not moving anything - does this make sense?


9. Normal Calc/File - Yossi - DONE.
13. Reload file after tessallation - Yossi (maybe together).
14. Resizing - Yossi - DONE.
15. Perspective Control GUI - Yossi - DONE.
16. Colors dialog connection - Ben.
