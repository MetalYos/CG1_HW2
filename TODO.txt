Todo List:

-----------------------TODO----------------------------------

7. Add View transformation - Yossi - Fix scaling in view space

17. Advanced options - for now the second option - Together.


New Parameters 
	For each polygon isSelected flag
	
On Mouse click while on select mode
	convert mouse position from screen space to view space
	fire the a ray from camera to mouse position
		for every polygon
			set flag = isHit
		
Meanwhile in onDraw
	if on select && Poly.isSelected
		EdgeColor = rgb( (WireframeColor + 128) % 255)




-----------------------DONE--------------------------------
6. Draw Normals - DONE for now (maybe add fix for scaling - low priority).

16. Colors dialog connection - DONE 
3. Each model have a list of geometries (otherwise BBox is wrong, example: cow) - DONE.
4. Create Perspective projections (using left, right, bottom, up, and using FOV and AspectRatio) - DONE.
5. Draw BoundingBox - DONE.
2. Reset the scene after loading a file (update GUI values) - Together.
3. Each model have a list of geometries (otherwise BBox is wrong, example: cow) - DONE.

1. Fix destructors (instead of  for loop, do a while loop where each iteration pops) - Yossi.

15. Perspective Control GUI, connections - Together.

12. Tessalltion dialog and connection to scene
	Need to clear screen and reload file after making change
	
11. Enable more than one axis.
	Z axis SCALE & TRANSFORM on ortho not moving anything - does this make sense?


9. Normal Calc/File - Yossi - DONE.
13. Reload file after tessallation - Yossi (maybe together).
14. Resizing - Yossi - DONE.
15. Perspective Control GUI - Yossi - DONE.
16. Colors dialog connection - Ben.
